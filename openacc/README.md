## Specification

See the [OpenACC home page](http://www.openacc-standard.org/) for the latest specification.

### OpenACC 2+

[Atomics in Different Programming Models](https://github.com/jeffhammond/HPCInfo/wiki/Atomics-in-Different-Programming-Models)

## Implementations

The current providers of OpenACC compilers are Cray (Fortran only now), NVIDIA (formerly PGI) and GCC.

Intel "supports" OpenACC via a source-to-source translation tool: https://github.com/intel/intel-application-migration-tool-for-openacc-to-openmp.
